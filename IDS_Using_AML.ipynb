    "# Intrusion Detection System using Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) \n",
    "As many network services and functionalities rely on AI/ML models, they are becoming increasingly vulnerable to AML attacks. AML attacks exploit the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of ML models by generating adversarial inputs that can deceive or manipulate the models into making incorrect predictions. In networks, AML attacks pose a significant threat to overall network security and reliability.  \n",
    "This case study aims to demonstrate the detrimental impact that AML attacks can have on ML models in networks and presents basic defense strategies to mitigate these attacks, thereby ensuring the accuracy of the ML-based IDS. In this case study, three common types of adversarial attacks ((i.e., DTA, FGSM, and BIM)) are used to generate adversarial samples to probe the vulnerability of the IDS.  \n",
    "Subsequently, basic defense mechanisms, including adversarial sample detection and filtering, are devised to safeguard the AutoML-based IDS against AML attacks.  "
