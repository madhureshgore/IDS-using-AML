# Intrusion Detection System using Adversarial Machine Learning
This project demonstrates how to implement an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Adversarial Machine Learning (AML). The goal is to explore and evaluate the impact of adversarial attacks on network traffic data using various machine learning techniques.

# Requirements
Python 3.9
Jupyter Notebook

# The two types of adversarial attacks used in the project are:

### Label Flip Attack: 
In the poisoning attack, the attacker deliberately injects false data or labels into the training dataset to corrupt the model's learning process. The goal can be to degrade the model’s accuracy or to manipulate the model’s behavior in a specific way.
### Model Extraction Attack: 
An attack where an attacker creates a substitute model to approximate the functionality of the target model.
These attacks illustrate different aspects of adversarial machine learning, with label flip attacks falling under the category of data poisoning and model extraction attacks targeting the model's intellectual property.
